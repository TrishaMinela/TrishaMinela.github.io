            The goal of South Forecast is to provide weather and climate information in the south region of the Luzon island. It is know that this region mostly experiences rainy or dry weather, however, the population seeks to be safe from typhoons and extreme storms. Weather forecast will also be helpful to assist with the protection of society from everyday activities that the weather can have an impact on. The website will advocate the protection of life and property through educating on the significance of the influence of weather.

            "How often can you look at the mountains around here and not be bored? How long can you sit by the shore of a lake and look out at the water and not feel bored? How frequently can you see a sunset and still be thrilled with it? There is something in the natural world, the God-made world, that knows how to speak to our souls in a way that human technology never can... there is something in us that, when we have some free time, makes us want to go up to the mountains. We want to watch the sunset. We want to sit by the shore and look at the water. Something tells us, “This defines your place in the universe.” It gives us the reassuring message that when we have reached the limits of human power and knowledge, there is a greater power that begins where ours leaves off."

            The Artist Feed is purposely created for all, as it challenges individuals, both the artist and the audience. It will be great to receive feedback whether the audience who have a specific set of beliefs concerning the context and meaning of the artworks will value how it has been interpreted by the artists. The audience will be able to explore the artist’s art, a mock-up display of the art (if being sold), the artist statement and artist background. They can send feedback, contact the artist and make a bid on a specific artwork. These feedback may be posted on the website.
