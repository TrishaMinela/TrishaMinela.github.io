            <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
        </div>
            <h4>Spotify</h4>
            <a href="https://www.spotify.com/ph-en/" target="_blank">Spotify.com</a>

            <img src="images/spotify.jpg" alt="Spotify">
            <p> The website of Spotify as can be viewed at a mobile screen exemplifies a careful but prominent application of visual hierarchy. The website is not only clean and organized but it takes the users eyes to the more focal elements first and the less important element last.</p>
            <p>When you view their website the first thing your eyes reads is the text in the center that is in neon green that says, "Listening is everything". It hits you right first. Then it leads you down to the call for action button that says 'Get Spotify Free' in the same color. Finally, the navigation bar at the top in black with the Spotify Label and hamburger menu on the right. </p>

            <h2>White Space</h2>
        </div>
            <h4>Engoo</h4>
            <a href="https://engoo.com/" target="_blank">Engoo.com</a> 
            <br>
            <img src="images/engoo.jpg" alt="Engoo">
            <p> For the website Engoo, they effectively and heavily use white space. The amount of negative space on their website as can be seen in the mobile screenshot, allows the users eyes to breathe and not get overwhelemed with information.</p>
            <p>On their mobile version site, besides the consistency of the contrast, the clean use of image, and the amount of text, the white space most of all created the balance and organization of the website. It is distinct that the important text at the bottom along with the call for action button to book a lesson are related therefore there is less whitespace in between. Contrary, white space were utilized to create distinction between the large text near the centre and the image above. The white space contrasted the simple contrast of color in their logo and made the website look professional and sophisticated.</p>

            <h2>Contrast</h2>
        </div>
            <h4>BYU Pathway</h4>
            <a href="https://www.byupathway.org/" target="_blank">Byupathway.org</a>
            <br>
            <img src="images/byup.jpg" alt="BYU Pathway">
            <p> BYU Pathway is known for their use of contrast in the color yellow, gray, and white. This was implemented well on their website and even at a great balance on the mobile version.</p>
            <p>The text is either gray or white depending if the background is yellow or white. What stands out as well is the same color has been used for the image of the graduates at the main part of the site. There is a wash of gray in the image that allows the white text and the yellow button to stand out and be readable. This way, the contrast becomes consistent and not messy.</p>
